Installing:
  make

  One command. Should take about 4 minutes. Installs everithing is ms/opt -
  the local project directory.

Running the MSA cleanup utility:
  You can use the classifier right away. Simply run the ./008-remover
  and it will print out the usage help.

Running the complete experiment:
  Data, with the exception of the classifier, is not included. Follow 
  data/DATA_README for instruction on downloading versions of CDD and Uniprot.

  Once data tar.gz are downloaded, run each command manually:
  002-start, 004-reshape-cdd, 006-reshape-uniprot, 008-sample, ...

  006-reshape-uniprot is by far the most time consuming, it converts
  FASTA to TAB and takes 7.6 hours. 009-add-random can take about 1 hour.
  Some steps will need to know what sample size you what to operate on.
