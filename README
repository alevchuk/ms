Tested on:
  Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (Lenny)

Installing:
  One command is all it takes. Simpy type: make. Should take about 4 minutes.
  Installs everithing is <project>/opt - the local project directory.

Running the MSA cleanup utility:
  You can use the classifier right away. Simply run the ./008-remover
  and it will print out the usage help.

Running the complete experiment:
  Data, with the exception of the classifier, is not included. Follow 
  data/DATA_README for instruction on downloading versions of CDD and Uniprot.

  Once data tar.gz are downloaded, run each command manually:
  002-start, 004-reshape-cdd, 006-reshape-uniprot, 008-sample, ...

  006-reshape-uniprot is by far the most time consuming non-parralizable task,
  it converts FASTA to TAB and takes 7.6 hours. 009-add-random can take 1 hour
  depending on sample size and how many samples taken. Some steps will need to
  know specifics such as what sample size to operate on. 010-run-guidance and
  026-run-guidance are highly paralalizable each unit only take a few minutes
  but there are SAMPLE_SIZE x NUM_SAMPLES x (1 + NUM_RANDOM_INJECTIONS) units.
